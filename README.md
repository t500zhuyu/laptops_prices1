In this project I use MySQL to analyze laptop products, I use queries to analyze the prices, products by company, the operating systems used in the laptops,
RAM capacity, GPU, laptop types, screen type, panel types, weight, inches, and so on.

Some of the functions that I used were:

* GROUP BY
* ORDER BY
* ROUND
* COUNT
* LIMIT
* SUM
